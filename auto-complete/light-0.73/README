Lightning completion package
----------------------------------
(Version 0.60 of 1999/04/28)

The lightning completion package lets Emacs use "dynamic completion"
on any number of things.  By dynamic completion, I mean that you don't
need to hit the tab key to initiate completion: once it is on, it
stays on until there is a unique completion or it is turned off.  This
can be disconcerting at first, but once you get used to it, it is
quite useful--especially when used with commands like find-file or
describe-function.

The lightning completion package was written by Mark Haiman and Nick
Reingold, then modified by John Palmieri (including getting everything
to work with Emacs 19).  Many suggestions were made by various people
at MIT, Yale, and elsewhere.


The lightning completion distribution files are:

   Changelog:    A log of changes made to various parts of the package.
   INSTALLATION: Installation instructions.
   Makefile:     Helps you install the package.
   README:       This file.
   light.el:     The main file in the lightning completion package.
   light.texi:   Lightning completion documentation, in texinfo format.
   recent-changes.html:  A more verbose, less formal list of changes 
                 than is in ChangeLog.

Actually, all you really need is the file light.el, unless you want to 
read documentation or something like that.
