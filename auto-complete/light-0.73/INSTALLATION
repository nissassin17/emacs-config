To install the lightning completion package, here's what you do:

  0. (You've probably already done this.)  Get the archive, which is
     called something like "light.tar.gz" or "light.tgz".  Run:
        gunzip light.tar.gz
        tar xf light.tar
     (or   tar xfz light.tar.gz   if your version of tar is good enough).
     This produces a directory called light-0.60 (the "0.60" is the
     version number, so that part may vary).  Change to that directory:
        cd light-0.60

  A few optional steps:

  1. (This step is optional, but it will make things run a bit
     faster.)  Byte-compile the el-files: if you run emacs by typing
     "emacs", then run: 
        make elc
     If you run emacs by typing something else (e.g., "emacs-20.3" or
     "xemacs"), run:
        make EMACS=emacs-20.3 elc
     or
        make EMACS=xemacs elc
     or whatever.

  2. (This step is optional, but if you want to read the online
     documentation, you need to do this.)  Run:
        make info
     to create info files, usable by Info mode in Emacs.  Run 
        make dvi
     to create dvi files.

  (You can combine steps 1 and 2: run 'make', or
  'make EMACS=emacs-20.3' or 'make EMACS=xemacs' or ...)

  3. (Everything else.)  In brief: make sure that the directory
     "light-0.60/lisp" is in your load-path, and `require' the
     package light.

  In more detail:

  3a. In your .emacs file, you need a line like
        (setq load-path (cons "PATH" load-path))
     where PATH is the pathname of the lisp subdirectory of
     light-0.60.  For instance, this might be
        (setq load-path (cons "/home/palmieri/emacs/light-0.60/lisp"
 	                      load-path))

     Note: I have the following in my .emacs file:
        (setq load-path (cons "/home/palmieri/emacs/light/lisp"
 	                      load-path))
     While in the "emacs" directory, I run:
        ln -s light-0.60 light
     This way, whenever I happen to download and install light-0.61,
     I run
        cd ~/emacs
        rm light
        ln -s light-0.61 light
     and I don't have to edit my .emacs file.

  3b. In your .emacs file, you also need the following line:
        (require 'light)
      This lets you use the Lightning Completion package.

  3c. (Alternatively, if you have the appropriate access, you could
      put the light-0.60 directory in /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
      or some such place.)

  4.  Restart Emacs and customize the packages as desired, by
      using the command
        M-x customize-group lightning-completion
