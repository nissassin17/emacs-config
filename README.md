#Emacs config
This is my Emacs config I created in 2012.
I have already switched to vim now.

By dint of having to complete Scheme exercise in school that I think Emacs is more fit than vim, I came back to Emacs at the moment. But I am too lazy to reformat these files ^^

Enjoy using it if you interested in
